					mining community. We want to help remove learning and technical barriers to setting up data mining environments and models, and also provide clarity and direction on the best

				Currently it can take new adopters of data mining technology days, if not weeks, to get up and running on solving their big data problems. Our goal is that through our work, we can reduce this time to minutes for each and every aspiring data miner.
