                <p> Data mining has been very successful in addressing big data problems for large corporations, and has been key to spurring and nurturing growth in Fortune 500 companies 
					which use the technology religiously to enhance products, personalize customer experiences, and optimize internal processes.  However, it is also due to this success 
					that data scientist/researcher resources and commercial data mining package costs are now beyond the reach of all except the big corporations.  Costs not withstanding, 
					there is also a shortage of people with data scientist skill sets to match the demand for this type of work.  This confines the impact that data mining can have, as it 
					can be applied to solve even more problems that are important in the world today, such as those being tackled by governments around the world to reduce poverty and crime,
					and those being addressed by the multitudes of start-ups working on a range of problems from improving the quality of health care in the world, to reducing power consumption 
					to save the earth\'s resources.</p>

				<p>Here at Open Data Mining, our vision is to bring data mining to the masses.  We are a group of people passionate about this charter.  Our goal is to bring visibility to great
					open-source data management and data mining packages available out there today, and to help reduce adoption barriers in order to accelerate productivity for those in the data
					mining community. We want to help remove learning and technical barriers to setting up data mining environments and models, and also provide clarity and direction on the best 
					solutions for different types of big data problems.  We will host talks/videos that will provide training from experts in the field, and blogs that will share data mining best 
					practices for anyone interested in learning or improving their applied data science/mining skills.</P>

				<p> Current active projects in the Open Data Mining Group include the study of popular and new state-of-the-art algorithms, researching the best open-source implementation of these algorithms, 
				and identifying the most efficient ways to set up the data and modeling environment to work seamlessly with these tools.  We will be mining some real-life data sets and documenting best practices.  Currently it can take new adopters of data mining technology days, if not weeks, to get up and running on solving their big data problems.  Our goal is that through our work, we can reduce this time to minutes for each and every aspiring data miner. </p>
